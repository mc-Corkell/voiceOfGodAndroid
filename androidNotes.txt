ANDROID 

There are activities, there's the main activity and the program flows around from the opening and closing of those. 

layouts = views 
View objects are widgets like buttons or text fields 
ViewGroup objects are invisible view containers that define how the child view are laid out (like in a grid or vertical list) 

XML defines these. 

Intent takes two parameters, the context (activity class is a subclass of context, and the class to which the system should deliver the intent - the activity that should be started!  

intent takes key name of parameter and value as second parameter. 
In order for the next activity to query the extra data, put it as a public constant. 
the strings at the top the public final constants are just the names of the keys that they'll use later to get the values. 
N
activity signals its own destruction by calling finish()
finish() calls onDestroy(); 

sqlite returns a cursor to iterate over the db

TO DEBUG 
System.out.println goes to the LogCat, use the tag:System.out in the search bar!
